# My Favorite Ukrainian Dishes
There is one mobile first page where you can find some information about my favorite ukrainian food and how to cook it at home.

## Description
Pick 3 things you love and create an app that showcases those things. Design a database that contains at least 4 columns - you must include an image of some kind and descriptive data about each of those things. Use the class authoring files as a reference - however DO NOT use the design files - make something better.

## Installation
No particular installation required. Download repo and open in a code editor. Content will require a Live Server to view properly.

## Assignment Requirements:
Design a mobile-first one page web application that highlights your favourite things. Use images, video, 3D - anything at all. You must have a database with at least 4 columns - you MUST have title / heading (text), image(s) and descriptive text. Include a landing / splash page with some controls to showcase each of your favourite things. You should also include some kind of error handling if things go awry. Use modern tools and techniques to generate the required assets. Use SASS components for your CSS and JS components where appropriate.

## Credits
Learning how to add the data from the database using lightbox. Unfortunatly in this project I couldn't do that but I don't give up and try to do my best to solve this issue.
